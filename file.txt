"Dear [Recipient],

I am writing to request an extension on submitting my UG provisional certificate. Due to prior commitments, I won't be able to collect it from Vishakapatnam before December 16th. However, I will ensure submission by January 15th.

In the meantime, I have attached my marksheets for your reference. I kindly request your approval to extend the deadline.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
[Your Name]"
