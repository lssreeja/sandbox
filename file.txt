I consistently ensure to deliver high-quality, clean, and reusable code . I use Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices and ensure all possible scenarios are covered. I also actively participate in team ceremonies. I am completing all my assigned trainings in time.

I make sure my code is clean with no defects and no regression issues after release. I maintain over 90% code coverage. I have also written BDD and end-to-end tests using Cypress. Iâ€™m also attending Azure training to improve my skills.
I fill timesheet in time and I have been a buddy to a junior.
